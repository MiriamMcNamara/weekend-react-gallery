Phase 1:
===

- put six images into the images folder, and update the gallery.router.js to create an object for each image within a gallery array
- create a _template folder and _template.jsx to use when creating components
- create a GalleryList component and a GalleryItem component
- import and mount the components and test them out in the browser
- import axios and useState and create a function that gets the images from the server, stores them in App.js and passes them to the GalleryList via props
- import useEffect and use it to get the images on page load
